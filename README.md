> Free and open-source, feature-rich [*Rarity Borders*](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2884802891) alternative for tModLoader.

**Better Rarity Borders** displays an item's rarity's color around the item (lining the item slot) as a border.

This is a free and open-source alternative to the original *Rarity Borders* mod that aims to have a higher level of quality control.

Natively works with Magic Storage, Boss Checklist, and any other mod that uses item slots!
